Fix the composer's ↑/↓ input-history recall doing nothing right after the first message of a new session. The history is now persisted to localStorage and re-read on mount, so the docked composer no longer starts empty when it takes over from the empty-session composer. Slash commands are now recorded too — both typed-and-submitted and ones picked from the slash menu — so they can be recalled like plain messages.
